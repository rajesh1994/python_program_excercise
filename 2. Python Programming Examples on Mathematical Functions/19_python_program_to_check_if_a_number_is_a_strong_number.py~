"""
    Note : A Polynomial can be expressed in terms that only have positive integer exponents and the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
    
    In other words, it must be possible to write the expression without division.
    
    Examples of Polynomials:
    x^2 + 2x +5 --- Since all of the variables have integer exponents that are positive this is a polynomial.

    5x^-2 +1 --- Not a polynomial because a term has a negative exponent

    3xÂ½ +2 --- Not a polynomial because a term has a fraction exponent
