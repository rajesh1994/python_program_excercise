Problem Statement :  Python Program to Compute the Value of Euler’s Number e
"""

"""
What is Euler’s Number (e) and where did it come from?
    Euler’s number has a value of 2.718… , however just like Pi, it is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be written as a fraction and that it has a decimal expansion which will continue forever without repetition.

    Euler’s number e has become famous for two main reasons: firstly, it is used in lots of important real-life situations, and secondly it has many interesting mathematical properties. This makes e a fascinating and useful number for scientists, engineers, and mathematicians alike.

Euler's Formula:
    e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + …… 1/n!

Where is Euler’s Number e used in the real world?
    How populations grow
    How temperature changes as materials heat up or cool down
    Radioactive decay of particles
