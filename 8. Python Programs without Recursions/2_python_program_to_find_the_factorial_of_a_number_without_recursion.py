Problem Solution
1. Take a number from the user.
2. Initialize a factorial variable to 1.
3. Use a while loop to multiply the number to the factorial variable and then decrement the number.
4. Continue this till the value of the number is greater than 0.
5. Print the factorial of the number.
6. Exit.
