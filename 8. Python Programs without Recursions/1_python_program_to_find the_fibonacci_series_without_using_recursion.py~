"""
Problem Statement : Python program to find the fibonacci series without using recursion
"""

"""
Fibonacci Series:

A series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.
"""

"""
Problem Solution:
1. Take the first two numbers of the series and the number of terms to be printed from the user.
2. Print the first two numbers.
3. Use a while loop to find the sum of the first two numbers and then proceed the fibonacci series.
4. Print the fibonacci series till n-2 is greater than 0.
5. Exit.

    n1 = n2
    n2 = n
    print (n, end = " ")
